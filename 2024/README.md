# Advent of Code

My solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

Here is this architecture to run correctly the python files
 - ref is the text file with the example in the subject
 - input is the puzzle input
> I don't push the input and ref file according to the repo as the creator of AOC wishes

```
└── DayX
    ├── ref
    ├── input
    ├── part1.py
    └── part2.py
```
